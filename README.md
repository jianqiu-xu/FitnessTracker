# FitAI – Personalized Fitness Training App

FitAI is a full-stack iOS fitness training app built with SwiftUI that leverages AI to generate weekly training plans based on user goals and physical conditions. Whether your goal is to gain muscle, lose weight, or stay fit, FitAI creates a custom workout plan and tracks your progress with visual analytics.

## 🚀 Features

- User onboarding and profile setup (age, weight, fitness goal)
- Smart weekly workout plan generation using AI
- Real-time progress tracking with charts and visual stats
- Personalized experience based on user physical data and preferences
- Full SwiftUI UI with modern navigation and form components

## 🧠 How AI Is Used

- AI-generated weekly plans are created based on:
  - User inputs (age, weight, fitness level, goals)
  - Pretrained language model responses integrated into backend
- AI also helps adjust plans dynamically based on completed workouts and feedback

(Current AI backend is in early development – plan generation may be simulated with mock data)
